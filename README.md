# Developing-Data-Products-Project

The goal of the project is to:
- Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.
- Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
- Share the application link
- Share your server.R and ui.R code on github
